The presentation by Professor Can Liu focuses on her work as a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher. She discussed designing multi-modal interfaces, mobile and spatial computing, and collaborative interfaces, emphasizing natural input modalities such as touch, hand manipulation, speech, and body movement. Professor Liu shared her research on understanding technology form factors, such as large displays and portable screens, and integrating AI into interfaces for improved interaction. She highlighted specific projects: understanding interaction with large displays for data analytics, developing techniques for 3D modeling on foldable phones, and designing interfaces that leverage AI for better speech input and text manipulation. Her work aims to make human-computer interaction more intuitive and efficient by considering how users interact with technology and integrating AI to support these interactions.

Professor Liu's presentation was highly informative and demonstrated a deep understanding of HCI's current challenges and opportunities. Her interdisciplinary approach, combining design, technology, and cognitive science, provides a comprehensive perspective on enhancing user experience with computing devices. However, the presentation might have benefited from including more concrete examples or demonstrations of how these technologies impact everyday users. While the theoretical foundation and research methodology were well-explained, adding user testimonials or case studies could have made the applications of her research more relatable to a broader audience. Nonetheless, her work's significance and potential impact on the future of human-computer interaction are clear and commendable.
