In this seminar, Prof. Murat Kantarcioglu delves into the evolving challenges and opportunities presented by the vast amounts of data generated in today's digital age, focusing on storage, processing, and the implications of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies. He discusses the development of systems like Hadoop and Apache Spark, the impact of cloud computing, and the necessity of securing data against cyberattacks, emphasizing the significance of AI/ML in transforming application landscapes. Furthermore, Kantarcioglu explores the complexities of data privacy and protection in light of regulations such as the GDPR, underscoring the need for robust security measures to safeguard AI and ML models from potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

Evaluating Prof. Kantarcioglu's presentation, it is evident that he provides a comprehensive overview of the critical issues at the intersection of big data, AI/ML technologies, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance. His ability to integrate technical solutions, such as encryption and hardware support for data security, with an understanding of legal and ethical considerations reflects a deep and nuanced grasp of the subject matter. However, while the breadth of topics covered is impressive, the presentation could benefit from more structured segmentation to enhance clarity and engagement. Additionally, integrating more real-world examples or case studies might further illustrate the practical implications of the discussed technologies and strategies, making the content more accessible and relatable to a wider audience.
