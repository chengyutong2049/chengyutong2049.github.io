# Translation between Molecules and Natural Language
{: .fs-9 }

[Code.](https://github.com/ccsnow127/MolT5)
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Method
* We propose MolT5: a self-supervised learning framework for jointly training a model on molecule string representations and natural language text, which can then be finetuned on a cross-modal task.
