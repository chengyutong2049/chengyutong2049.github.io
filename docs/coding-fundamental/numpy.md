## Introduction
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

## numpy.random.seed
* Reseed the singleton RandomState instance.
{: .text-delta }
```python
np.random.seed(42)
```
*  sets the seed for random number generation to 42 using NumPy's random module. 
*  This is done to ensure reproducibility in your code.
*  By setting the seed, you ensure that the sequence of random numbers generated by NumPy functions will be the same every time the code is run.
